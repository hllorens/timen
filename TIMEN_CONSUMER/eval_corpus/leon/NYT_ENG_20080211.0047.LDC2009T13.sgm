<P>
I've always considered Leap Year Day akin to the extra screw you
put in your sock drawer after misassembling a table.
</P>
<P>
The whole calendar thing just wasn't working out, so Julius
Caesar created a <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P365D">365-day</TIMEX3> year in 45 BC with an extra day <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="SET" value="P4Y" quant="EVERY">every
four years</TIMEX3> to make it work.
</P>
<P>
The year before, though, he blew out 46 BC to <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P445D">445 days</TIMEX3> to
recalibrate the calendar back to its original relationship with
the seasons. What he came up with became known, quite
understandably, as the Year of Confusion.
</P>
<P>
There's a word for all this: intercalary. It means the insertion
of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="SET" value="P1D" freq="1">a day</TIMEX3> or month into a calendar year. The Observer recommends
you drop the intercalary bomb in conversations to humiliate your
enemies.
</P>
<P>
Why am I focusing on Leap Year Day already? It is, after all, at
the far end of the month. Because Valentine's Day is coming at us
yet again <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2008-02-07">this Thursday</TIMEX3>, and I've already trashed it as the low-
rent holiday of the year.
</P>
<P>
So, in this intercalary month of this intercalary year, I say
let's go straight to the intercalary day. Everyone's gearing up
for it. There's a bash that starts at noon on the 29th at Belair
National Park in South Australia. According to The Honor Society
of Leap Year Day Babies, Martha Stewart is assembling a leap year
gang for her TV show that same day.
</P>
<P>
I've talked to a number of leap year babies, and they all feel
special. But then how else would they feel? The other three
birthdays in each cycle are relative duds, so they throw the long
ball on the Day of Days. Joanne Mariano, who works in Quincy,
takes <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> to celebrate. She's on to something but not quite
there yet. The Observer says <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P4D">four days</TIMEX3> for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3>. That's
only fair.
</P>
<P>
Leap year baby Pat Beggy, principal of the Morse School in
Cambridge, is ecstatic <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2008">this year</TIMEX3> because her leap year B-day is
in sync with her Zodiac sign, the Year of the Rat. This is
seriously good juju.
</P>
<P>
That's all grand, but if you really want to talk Leap Year Day,
you're talking Anthony, Texas/N.M. This is the leap year mecca,
the self-proclaimed ground zero of the leap year movement.
Anthony resident Mary Ann Brown, a leap year baby wouldn't you
know, dreamed this whole thing up in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1988">1988</TIMEX3>.
</P>
<P>
I asked her how it came about? Was it a slow <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2008-02-05">Tuesday</TIMEX3> or what? "I
have to admit it was sort of that," Mary Ann, who will be 19 in
LeapSpeak, this time around, says by phone. "I was looking for
something to promote the community. The press is always looking
for something special."
</P>
<P>
First some background: This town, as the address indicates, is
split on the border of Texas and New Mexico. The Texas side is
incorporated; the New Mexico side is not. I ask Mary Ann what the
population of Anthony is.
</P>
<P>
"Well," she pauses, "We're not so extremely well organized. I
suppose we could go to the census for that."
</P>
<P>
OK, what about size? "Let's see. On the New Mexico side, it goes
from the state line up to ... I want to say O'Hara Road. That's
about 2 miles. East to west, it's from I-10 to the old Highway
28."
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann's picture graced the Las Cruces Sun-News twice as a
child for the sole reason that she was born <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2008-02-29">Feb. 29</TIMEX3>. She liked
that. Later she moved in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1951">1951</TIMEX3> from Las Cruces to Anthony after
marrying Joe Bob Brown, who owns an auto parts store in Anthony.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, back in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1988">1988</TIMEX3>, Mary Ann saw a picture of her neighbor
Birdie Lewis in the paper because she was a leap year baby. "A
light went on," says Brown, a member of the local Chamber of
Commerce. "I thought, you know, if the chamber took this on as a
project, we could make a promotion out of it.
</P>
<P>
"So I asked Birdie later that day to come with me to the Chamber
of Commerce meeting that night," she continues. "I told Birdie
that I'd pick her up at 6 o'clock. I didn't tell her anything
else."
</P>
<P>
They arrived at the meeting, and Mary Ann pitched a Worldwide
Leap Year Festival and a Worldwide Leap Year Birthday Club to the
Chamber. It was nonplussed until it bought in.
</P>
<P>
"Then I thought to myself, we might as well declare ourselves the
Leap Year Capital of the World," she says. "If we don't do it,
someone else will." The trifecta was complete.
</P>
<P>
The first Worldwide Leap Year Festival took place in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1988">1988</TIMEX3> in Joe
Bob's store, Anthony Auto Parts. Nine leap year babies showed up,
along with the mayor and about 40 others. Nothing shabby about
that kickoff. Mary Ann says there are <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> about 400 members of
the birthday club worldwide, and she's looking for 150 leapers to
show up on the 29th for fun and games.
</P>
<P>
<TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3>, Mary Ann was a <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">former</TIMEX3> journalist - she published her own
little "Mesilla Valley Perspective" for <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">about five years</TIMEX3> - so she
took the news up to the El Paso Times to get it in the paper and
on the Associated Press wire. It ran in both.
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann then refers me to the Ask The Globe feature of this
paper on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="1988-02-08">Feb. 8, 1988</TIMEX3>, where, she says proudly, Anthony is
mentioned in response to a reader's question about leap year
festivities. Alas, I could find nothing on that day, but, hold
on, Anthony was in print here on <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="1994-03-17">March 17, 1994</TIMEX3>.
</P>
<P>
So let us <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> praise Mary Ann Brown for her moxie and vision. And
if Anthony isn't exactly the mouse that roared, it is, at the
very least, the mouse that burped.
