Conductor Riccardo Muti named as 10th music director of Chicago
Symphony Orchestra

<P>
The Chicago Symphony Orchestra Association named Italian maestro
Riccardo Muti on Monday as the next music director of the CSO,
the 10th conductor to hold the prestigious post.
</P>
<P>
CSO Association President Deborah Card announced that Muti, 66,
had signed a five-year contract to serve as music director
beginning in September of the 2010-2011 season. The post has been
vacant since Daniel Barenboim retired in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the contract, Muti will conduct a minimum of
10 weeks of CSO subscription concerts each season, plus lead the
orchestra in domestic and international tours.
</P>
<P>
As music director designate, Muti will lead the CSO and its
chorus in performances of the Verdi Requiem next Jan. 15, 16 and
17, Card said.
</P>
<P>
Muti, a native of Naples, first led the CSO as a guest conductor
at the Ravinia Festival in 1973, but didn't return to Chicago
until last year. Rumors that he was being considered for the top
post began circulating after he led the orchestra in a sold-out
opening night gala for the 2007-2008 season and later a
triumphant European tour.
</P>
<P>
"I had the experience of conducting this fine orchestra last
year. Making music with these fine musicians was fantastic," Muti
told The Associated Press by telephone from Salzburg, Austria,
where he signed the Chicago contract while preparing for the
Salzburg Whitsun Baroque Festival, a brief spring adjunct to the
main summer festival.
</P>
<P>
Muti said he had decided several years ago not to make any long-
term conducting commitments, but began re-examining that decision
after the CSO European tour.
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere was so wonderful that I changed my mind," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Card, also in Salzburg, said she was delighted that Muti accepted
the post once held by such luminaries as the late Fritz Reiner
and Sir Georg Solti.
</P>
<P>
"To imagine, he hadn't come to us in 34 years, and now this,"
Card said. "I'm ecstatic, and so are all the musicians and staff
in Chicago."
</P>
<P>
Muti first came to the attention of critics in 1967 when he won a
major competition for conductors in Milan. He soon was appointed
to important positions in Florence and London. He has been a
regular guest conductor at the Salzburg Festival since 1971, and
is regarded by many critics as an outstanding Mozart interpreter.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., Muti is best known for his work as music director of
the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1980 to 1992. During his tenure
there, traditionalists objected to his deliberate stripping away
of the lush high-Romantic "Philadelphia sound" made famous by the
late Leopold Stokowski and Eugene Ormandy. Supporters, though,
praised Muti's leaner sound and said he often came closer to
composers' original concepts.
</P>
<P>
Muti's most prestigious appointment, as music director of Milan's
La Scala, began in 1986 and ended when he resigned in April 2005
amid bitter controversy after artistic and programming
differences with the opera house's former general manager, Carlo
Fontana, led to open conflict with the musicians after Fontana
was dismissed.
