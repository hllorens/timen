After compilation you must copy the TIMEN/lib/*.so sqlite4java libraries to the dist/lib folder.
Otherwise you will get an error.

If you want to use the NLP version you need to:
1) copy the Treetagger program-data/Tretagger/script in the Treetagger folder
2) specify the Treetagger path in the program-data/confing.properties
