CHICAGO <TIMEX3 value="2008-05-05T16:51:57" tid="t13" type="TIME">2008-05-05 16:51:57 UTC</TIMEX3>


The Chicago Symphony Orchestra Association named Italian maestro
Riccardo Muti on <TIMEX3 value="2008-05-05" tid="t3" type="DATE">Monday</TIMEX3> as the next music director of the CSO,
the 10th conductor to hold the prestigious post.


CSO Association President Deborah Card announced that Muti, 66,
had signed a <TIMEX3 value="P5Y" tid="t29" type="DURATION">five-year</TIMEX3> contract to serve as music director
beginning in <TIMEX3 value="2010-09" tid="t1" type="DATE">September</TIMEX3> of the <TIMEX3 value="2010" tid="t37" type="DATE">2010</TIMEX3>-<TIMEX3 value="2011" tid="t38" type="DATE">2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 value="PXM" tid="t30" type="DURATION">season</TIMEX3>. The post has been  
vacant since Daniel Barenboim retired in <TIMEX3 value="2006" tid="t5" type="DATE">2006</TIMEX3> .


Under the terms of the contract, Muti will conduct a minimum of
<TIMEX3 value="P10W" tid="t8" type="DURATION">10 weeks</TIMEX3> of CSO subscription concerts <TIMEX3 value="P1Y" tid="t31" type="SET" quant="EACH">each season</TIMEX3> , plus lead the
orchestra in domestic and international tours.


As music director designate, Muti will lead the CSO and its
chorus in performances of the Verdi Requiem <TIMEX3 value="2009-01-15" tid="t2" type="DATE">next Jan. 15</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 value="2009-11-16" tid="t32" type="DATE" anchorTimeID="t2">16</TIMEX3> and
<TIMEX3 value="2009-11-17" tid="t33" type="DATE" anchorTimeID="t2">17</TIMEX3> , Card said.


Muti, a native of Naples, first led the CSO as a guest conductor
at the Ravinia Festival in <TIMEX3 value="1973" tid="t16" type="DATE">1973</TIMEX3> , but didn't return to Chicago
until <TIMEX3 value="2007" tid="t12" type="DATE">last year</TIMEX3> . Rumors that he was being considered for the top
post began circulating after he led the orchestra in a sold-out
opening night gala for the <TIMEX3 value="2007" tid="t34" type="DATE">2007</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 value="2008" tid="t35" type="DATE">2008</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 value="PXM" tid="t36" type="DURATION">season</TIMEX3> and later a
triumphant European tour.


"I had the experience of conducting this fine orchestra <TIMEX3 value="2007" tid="t14" type="DATE">last
year</TIMEX3> . Making music with these fine musicians was fantastic," Muti
told The Associated Press by telephone from Salzburg, Austria,
where he signed the Chicago contract while preparing for the
Salzburg Whitsun Baroque Festival, a brief <TIMEX3 value="XXXX-SP" tid="t6" type="DATE">spring</TIMEX3> adjunct to the
main <TIMEX3 value="XXXX-SU" tid="t21" type="DATE">summer</TIMEX3> festival.


Muti said he had decided <TIMEX3 value="PAST_REF" tid="t17" type="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX3> not to make any long-
term conducting commitments, but began re-examining that decision
after the CSO European tour.


"The atmosphere was so wonderful that I changed my mind," he
said.


Card, also in Salzburg, said she was delighted that Muti accepted
the post <TIMEX3 value="PAST_REF" tid="t20" type="DATE">once</TIMEX3> held by such luminaries as the late Fritz Reiner
and Sir Georg Solti.


"To imagine, he hadn't come to us in <TIMEX3 value="P34Y" tid="t9" type="DURATION">34 years</TIMEX3> , and <TIMEX3 value="PRESENT_REF" tid="t4" type="DATE">now</TIMEX3> this,"
Card said. "I'm ecstatic, and so are all the musicians and staff
in Chicago."


Muti first came to the attention of critics in <TIMEX3 value="1967" tid="t10" type="DATE">1967</TIMEX3> when he won a
major competition for conductors in Milan. He soon was appointed
to important positions in Florence and London. He has been a
regular guest conductor at the Salzburg Festival since <TIMEX3 value="1971" tid="t11" type="DATE">1971</TIMEX3> , and
is regarded by many critics as an outstanding Mozart interpreter.


In the U.S., Muti is best known for his work as music director of
the Philadelphia Orchestra from <TIMEX3 value="1980" tid="t7" type="DATE">1980</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 value="1992" tid="t19" type="DATE">1992</TIMEX3> . During his tenure
there, traditionalists objected to his deliberate stripping away
of the lush high-Romantic "Philadelphia sound" made famous by the
late Leopold Stokowski and Eugene Ormandy. Supporters, though,
praised Muti's leaner sound and said he often came closer to
composers' original concepts.


Muti's most prestigious appointment, as music director of Milan's
La Scala, began in <TIMEX3 value="1986" tid="t15" type="DATE">1986</TIMEX3> and ended when he resigned in <TIMEX3 value="2005-04" tid="t22" type="DATE">April 2005</TIMEX3>
amid bitter controversy after artistic and programming
differences with the opera house's former general manager, Carlo
Fontana, led to open conflict with the musicians after Fontana
was dismissed.
