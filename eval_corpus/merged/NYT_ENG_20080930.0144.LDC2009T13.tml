I must confess that I never cared much for oompah music. But I
love Oktoberfest. Look around you, pork everywhere! I see juicy
loins, smoky chops and all manner of hocks, snouts, sausages and
feet, all demonstrating the unmatched culinary superiority of the
pig. I see scads of savory roasted chickens, buttered noodles
galore, tangy sauerkraut and piles of soft, fat, glistening
pretzels. This, my friends, is a party!


Of course, we can't forget the beer. Oktoberfest must have beer,
and plenty of it, to go along with all that food. And so,
appearing right about <TIMEX3 value="PRESENT_REF" tid="t7" type="DATE">now</TIMEX3> in bars and shops near you are the
seasonal brews reminiscent of those that <TIMEX3 value="PAST_REF" tid="t10" type="DATE">long ago</TIMEX3> toasted both
the Bavarian harvest and, incidentally, the return of the brewing
season, which in the times before refrigeration coincided with
cooler weather.


As we're always ready to join the party, the tasting panel
recently sampled 24 Oktoberfest beers. Florence Fabricant and I
were joined by two guests, Richard Scholz, an owner of Bierkraft
in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and Lew Bryson, a beer writer and the
managing editor of Malt Advocate magazine.


At the official Oktoberfest in Munich, the only beers permitted
to be served come from six local brewers: Hacker-Pschorr,
Paulaner, Lowenbrau, Hofbrau, Spaten and Augustiner.


The Bavarians have their rules, and we had ours, which simply
required the beers in our tasting to be made in the Oktoberfest
style, wherever they came from. As it happened, we had seven
German brews in our tasting (including four of the Munich six)
and 17 American brews. Pinning down the Oktoberfest style was the
hard part.


Munich's Oktoberfest began in <TIMEX3 value="1810" tid="t18" type="DATE">1810</TIMEX3> as a harvest festival
formalized to mark the wedding of Crown Prince Ludwig and
Princess Therese. The celebrators traditionally drank <TIMEX3 value="XXXX-03" tid="t14" type="SET">March</TIMEX3> beer,
or Marzen, which was brewed in <TIMEX3 value="XXXX-03" tid="t8" type="SET">March</TIMEX3> in large quantities before
the seasonal brewing hiatus and then stored, or lagered, in icy
caves. It was consumed gradually over the <TIMEX3 value="XXXX-SU" tid="t11" type="SET">summer</TIMEX3> , then finished
at Oktoberfest, which is why some bottles can paradoxically be
called both Marzen and Oktoberfest beer.


Marzen was then simply a strong, dark lager, though by <TIMEX3 value="PRESENT_REF" tid="t5" type="DATE">today</TIMEX3> 's
standards the beers, 5.5 percent to 6 percent alcohol, would be
considered rather mild. In the <TIMEX3 value="187" tid="t15" type="DATE">1870s</TIMEX3> , as new brewing techniques
developed, the Marzen style evolved into a copper-bronze brew,
with pronounced aromas of sweet malt balanced on the palate by
the subtle, refreshing bitterness provided by hops.


To much of the world, this is <TIMEX3 value="PRESENT_REF" tid="t19" type="DATE">now</TIMEX3> considered the accepted style
of Marzen and Oktoberfest beers. But change has reared its head
again in Germany, and in <TIMEX3 value="P30Y" tid="t20" type="DURATION">the last 30 years</TIMEX3> or so, many
Oktoberfest beers have turned golden, like pilsners. Possibly
this is the evolution of Oktoberfest beer. Or some German brewers
are pandering to a preference for lighter-colored beers. But
American brewers still adhere to the older bronze style


Regardless of the color, Oktoberfest beer must above all be
smooth and of great drinkability -- "not just drinkability, but
poundability!" Lew insisted, knowing that Oktoberfest consumption
is generally measured in liters, not glasses. But really, what is
drinkability? Wouldn't the most innocuous mass-market beer be
considered drinkable?


No! By drinkability I mean worthy of attention without demanding
to be the center of attention. A good Oktoberfest beer is a
masterpiece of balance and integration, delicious without being
extravagant. It does its job in the background, refreshing the
palate with enough flavor to pique the interest without
interfering with the conversation, the dancing, the ravenous
consumption of pork or the other typical Oktoberfest activities.


In our tasting we found many well-made beers that fulfilled the
Oktoberfest imperative. We were especially happy with the
American beers, which stuck closely to the traditional style.


Our top three beers, all American, are excellent examples of the
style. The No. 1 beer, Octoberfest from Thomas Hooker, was
beautifully balanced with each flavor component melding into a
delicious, refreshing whole.


If you ponder each sip, as we did in our tasting, you might
remark on the malt aromas or the way the bitterness of the hops
contributes to a clean, crisp feeling in the mouth after you
swallow. But if you are polishing off a bottle at a party, or
simply having a conversation with a friend or watching a
ballgame, you would simply notice how enjoyable the beer was and
reach for another.


The No. 2 beer, the Festbier from Victory, was similarly balanced
with a barely noticeable touch of licorice among the flavors,
while our No. 3, the Dogtoberfest Marzen from Flying Dog, was a
trifle more assertive, without overdoing it.


Three of the German beers made our top 10, including two of the
Munich six. The Paulaner Oktoberfest-Marzen had a bit more
complexity than some of the other beers, along with an unusual
floral quality. While the aroma seemed quite sweet, there was no
sweetness on the palate. The Hacker-Pschorr Original Oktoberfest
was, as were all of our favorites, well balanced, with slightly
more richness than the Paulaner but less complexity.


Our third German brew, Beck's Oktoberfest, was something of an
interloper, coming from the northwestern port city of Bremen. It
had a bit more bitter hop flavor than some of the others but was
nonetheless well integrated and enjoyable.


Two other German beers, the Hofbrau Oktoberfest and the
Weihenstephaner Festbier, were of the golden school. What's
worse, they were both thoroughly bland. Our Spaten Oktoberfest
Ur-Marzen, unfortunately, was marred by oxidation, sometimes a
problem with imported beers.


Several bottles didn't make our top 10 but were nonetheless
enjoyable, including the last German brew, the Ayinger
Oktoberfest-Marzen; the Penn Oktoberfest; and the Weyerbacher
Autumn Fest.


It occurred to me as we were tasting that some Mexican brews,
like Dos Equis and Negra Modela, might fall stylistically into
the Oktoberfest category. Did you ever notice how mariachi can
sound just like oompah?

BEERS By FLORENCE FABRICANT


"Round up the usual suspects," Captain Renault says in
"Casablanca." You could say the same of an Oktoberfest menu.
Sausages, roast chicken, pigs' knuckles and headcheese are
usually washed down with copious quantities of beer.


But Oktoberfest beers, from Germany and the United States, are
more versatile. These often subtle and food-friendly brews pair
nicely with a wider array of meats, poultry and even seafood.
Fresh clams go well, as does meaty grilled fish like striped
bass.


Cheeses, especially funky customers like Alsatian Muenster, and
even hearty salads make a good match.


Feeling the nip in the air, I assembled a bread salad inspired by
a Tuscan panzanella but more suited to the post-tomato season. It
is cloaked in autumn tones and flavors, with cubes of butternut
squash, pieces of cauliflower and hearty whole grain bread. This
dish could be a first course for a beer dinner or a fine
accompaniment for the usual suspects.


Autumn Panzanella Time: <TIMEX3 value="PT45M" tid="t21" type="DURATION">45 minutes</TIMEX3> , plus <TIMEX3 value="PT4H" tid="t3" type="DURATION">4 hours</TIMEX3> ' marinating  3
