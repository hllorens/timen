We present TIMEN, a resource for building and sharing knowledge and rules for TimeML temporal expression normalization subtask - that is, the generation of a TIMEX3 annotation from a linguistic temporal expression. This sets a strong basis built from current best approaches which is independent from the rest of temporal expression processing subtasks.
Therefore, it can be easily integrated as a module in temporal information processing systems.

Since it is open it can be used, improved and extended by the community, in contrast to closed tools, which must be replicated from scratch as the field advances. Furthermore, TIMEN eases the development of normalization knowledge and rules for low-resourced languages since the normalization process is partially shared between languages.
